   - The Teams page provides concise details about each team, accompanied by a button for accessing more in-depth information.
   - The register page requires users to input their username, email, password, and confirm password — ensuring all fields are mandatory for the creation of a new user account.
   - The login page requires users to input a valid email and password for authentication.
        
* The private part visible after successful authentication and authorization:
   - Users can make their teams on the Create page.

 # Security 
 - Guards: By using both public and private guards effectively, an application can maintain a balance—sharing essential information publicly while protecting sensitive functions and data.  
 - 404 Page: A customized page for 404 errors gracefully manages undefined routes. 
 - Error Boundary: Capture JavaScript errors throughout the child component tree, log the errors, and present a fallback UI instead of causing the entire app to crash.

# Utilized Additional Libraries
 - React bootstrap
 - React router dom
